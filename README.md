# Costa Dataset

Custom object detection dataset containing 3051 labelled images and 7266 instances of various items available at Costa Coffee.

The images were used to train YOLOv3 with darknet for use in the First SciRoc Challenge 2019 by team LASR. This allowed our TIAGo
robot verify orders and identify the status of each table in the Coffee Shop scenario, in which our team was awarded 1st place!
